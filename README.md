## *Hello World--*  
#### Why this website?
Hello world, This website is made to show case the achievements of our team MNSS, Rai[Sonepat], give information about our game and encourages physical fitness and skill development while providing educational content and entertainment. It also offers monetization opportunities through ads, memberships, and merchandise.

#### Just Dev things
On a really interesting note, Webflow has launched a React component export tool. I am considering moving all component design and management over to Webflow for easier tooling for marketing teams and visual designers! 
Jest has been setup, but no progress on building tests has been made. Life is busy atm! 
I am currently taking a short break in development of this theme. I am in the final phases of a job search, and getting ready to move into a bigger place to give some much needed room to my growing family! I am hoping to continue development before the end of next quarter!

## This website is still being developed! ðŸ¥³
This website application has currently hit the Beta phase and is ready to be forked if you are familiar with React and Next. The next release cycle will focus on a better DXâ€”moving from local JSON to MongoDB, setting up Sanity for GUI page editing, Unit Testing with Jest, adding TypeScript, etc.

#### Next & App Architecure

## Please fork this repo! ðŸ¦„
This is a website for the rai-gymanstics team and for our coach Dr T S Kundu
Please give a star and fork this repo to edit it and use it as a template

It is my hope that by sharing this project it can give others a chance to enjoy learning about Nextjs and gymnastics game (and have as much fun as I did), and hopefully brings value to people as a portfolio and networking tool!
It would be keep updating and virtual reality experiences, the hard core excercises and a AI virtual coach which will teach you excersises and game will also be available here soonn...
